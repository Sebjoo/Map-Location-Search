# Map-Location-Search
A simple edit to 7erraÂ´s Map Marker Search Script, that helps finding locations on the Map instead of Markers. 

Features: 
Live distance from the player to the Locations
Clicking on the Location, centers the Camera on it
Search Bar to look for a specific locations
Can be disabled by the small checkbox

To install, simply place the folder "mapsearch" in your Missionfile and add the content from the Init into yours. 
The Locations work on every Arma 3 Map, as the list gets pulled from the CFGWorlds. You can also change it to specific locations if you dont want to have them all displayed. 
Open the cities.sqf and execlude the upper code and put in your costum locations as shown as example in the file.
